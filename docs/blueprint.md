# **App Name**: SafeGuard

## Core Features:

- Accident Detection: Accident Detection: Use device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to detect sudden impacts or unusual movements indicative of an accident. Refine detection via machine learning tool for higher accuracy and fewer false positives.
- Contact Setup: Contact Setup: Provide a form to input the primary contact number within the application's settings.
- Automated Messaging: Message Sending: When an accident is detected, automatically send a message to the pre-configured primary contact number, using an external messaging service. The message should include location details if available.
- Automated Calling: Call Initiation: Initiate an automated phone call to the pre-configured primary contact number using a third-party calling service upon accident detection.
- Manual Activation: Emergency Mode Activation: Implement a manual emergency trigger within the app for users to activate in situations where automatic detection might fail. This trigger initiates the same messaging and calling sequences.
